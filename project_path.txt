2. Research Procedural Generation Algorithms

Explore common algorithms for procedural generation in your chosen domain. Some examples:

>   Terrain Generation:
      > Perlin Noise, Simplex Noise.
        Diamond-Square Algorithm.
        Cellular Automata (for caves or dungeons).
    Dungeon Layouts:
        Random Walks.
        Binary Space Partitioning (BSP).
        Maze-generation algorithms (e.g., Prim's, Kruskal's).
    Character/Item Generation:
        Weighted randomization.
        Markov Chains for patterns.
        Grammar-based systems (for naming or descriptions).

3. Design a Modular Architecture

Think about how to make your generator modular, so developers can easily plug in custom algorithms or constraints.
Core Components:

    Generator Interface: A common interface for all content types (e.g., traits or enums) that defines how generators work.
    Plugins/Modules: Each content type (e.g., terrain, dungeons) should be a self-contained module implementing the interface.
    Pipeline System: Allow users to chain multiple generators together (e.g., generating a base heightmap and applying erosion or smoothing).
    Export System: Define how the output is saved or visualized (e.g., as images, JSON files, or directly into a game engine).

4. Create a Simple CLI or API

Build a CLI or API that allows users to interact with your generator. Start simple:

    A command-line interface where users can specify:
        Content type (--terrain, --dungeon).
        Configuration options (--width=100 --height=100).
        Output format (--output=map.png).
    An API for developers to use the generator programmatically in their projects.

5. Plan for Extensibility

Build your project with future expansion in mind:

    Input Parameters: Allow users to define custom parameters for their generators (e.g., frequency, amplitude for noise-based terrain).
    Hooks and Callbacks: Let developers add custom steps in the generation process.
    Custom Modules: Provide a way to load third-party modules or scripts (e.g., via dynamic linking or script integration).

6. Implement the First Generator

Start small:

    Pick one type of content (e.g., terrain).
    Implement a basic version of a well-known algorithm (e.g., Perlin noise).
    Visualize the output (e.g., export a grayscale heightmap as an image).

7. Add Modular Features

After you have a basic generator:

    Add support for chaining generators (e.g., apply noise, then add rivers or biomes).
    Allow configuration via files (e.g., JSON/YAML).
    Build reusable utility functions for common tasks (e.g., randomization, grid manipulation).

8. Optimize and Test

    Optimize performance, especially for large-scale content generation.
    Test for edge cases (e.g., parameter values that produce invalid results).
    Allow users to visualize or debug intermediate steps in the generation process.

9. Document and Share

    Write clear documentation on how to use the tool and extend it.
    Share your generator as an open-source library or a standalone CLI tool for other developers.

10. Iterate and Expand

Once your first generator is complete:

    Add more content types as separate modules.
    Explore advanced features, like real-time generation or integration with game engines (e.g., exporting to Unity or Godot).
